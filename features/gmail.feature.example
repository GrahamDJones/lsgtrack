Feature: Gmail
  In order to send real world emails
  As the application
  I want to ensure that my configuration is correct

  Background:
    Given there are the following users:
      | email                 | password   |
      | alice@example.com     | password   |
      | example@example.com | example |
    And Action Mailer delivers via SMTP

    Given there is a project called "Time Tracker"
    And "alice@example.com" can view the "Time Tracker" project
    And "exampler@example.com" can view the "Time Tracker" project
    And "example@example.com" has created a ticket for this project:
      | title        | description      |
      | Release date | TBA very shortly |

  Scenario:  Receiving a real-world email
    Given I am signed in as "alice@example.com"
    Given I am on the homepage
    When I follow "Time Tracker"
    And I follow "Release date"
    And I fill in "Text" with "Posting a comment"
    And I press "Create Comment"
    Then I should see "Comment has been created"

    When I log into gmail with:
      | username              | password   |
      | example@example.com | example |
    Then there should be an email from lsg.tracker in my inbox
